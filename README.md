# Helmet-Detection

## Project Overview

Safety Helmet Detection is a computer vision project that aims to enhance workplace safety by ensuring individuals are wearing safety helmets. The project utilizes the YOLOv10 model for object detection to identify people and determine if they are wearing helmets.

## Features

-   Real-time detection of safety helmets
-   High accuracy with YOLOv10 model
-   Easy-to-run Jupyter notebook

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

     `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Safety-Helmet-Detection.git` 
    
2.  Open the `Helmet_Detection.ipynb` file in Google Colab.

## Usage

1.  Upload the `Safety_Helmet_Detection.ipynb` file to your Google Drive.
2.  Open the notebook in Google Colab.
3.  Run the cells sequentially to:
    -   Install necessary libraries and dependencies
    -   Load and preprocess the dataset
    -   Train the YOLOv10 model
    -   Perform detection on sample images
    -   Evaluate the model performance
